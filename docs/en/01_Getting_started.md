# Warning

Hypatia is alpha lib, do not use it in production yet! It still in active development.

# Quick start

You can install all packages from Hypatia Project or just some depending on your needs.

You need `composer` to install them.

To install every thing:

```bash
composer require hypatia/hypatia
```

To install just one part:

```bash
composer require hypatia/part-name
```
